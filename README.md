cdi-persistence-test
====================

CDI persistence test with CDI-Unit, Hibernate 4.3.5 (JPA 2.1) and static metamodel generation.

This is a work-around to have CDI-enabled persistence tests without the need of having an EE container and specify the classes in persistence.xml. It is actually a replacement method for EJB3Configuration programmatic configuration.
